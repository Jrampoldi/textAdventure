The corner of Ad Astra. Cliffs surround you from the North and West. Sun ripples through the thick vegetation of the forrest. Something catches your eye on a cut tree stump. A book. Coordinates... You may want that if you ever want to leave.
The forrest continues. Its quiet in this section... Nothing more than the wind through the trees and the ocean crash on the cliffs to the north. 
Hmm... Apart from the vegetation, there is no other sign of animal life in this part of the world. Strange...
Trees seem to stretch out of sight... There is a gate for a farm to the south. aggressive.. sounds to the east.
