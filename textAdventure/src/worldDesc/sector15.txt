A road in the middle leads North and South. There are mountains to the east. Looks ominous. Might be a good view though.
A cool breeze breaking through the mountain tops and the smell of salt. Apart from some rustling, it is pretty peaceful right here.
The road breaks coming from West to North and South. There is a path to the east that leads to a mountain range. 
From the west, the path diverged. You climbed up a trail that ends to a sign that warns of travel North. West lies mountains that are too steep for climbing.
