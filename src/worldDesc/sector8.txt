A building lies in front of you with a farmer out front looking at the house. Say hello.
A freshly cut lawn with a fence to the north and east. To the west a house lies and someone standing close.
Here you stand, staring up towards a barn. Its kind of big. Hmm.. doors seem locked. There is also a fence south and west of the Barn. A key lies on a table.
Through the gate lies another enclosed field, with a barn style building to the west, and a house to the north-west. Must be Khav'niks home...
