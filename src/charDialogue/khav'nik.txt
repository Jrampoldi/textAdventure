intro
Hello stranger. I am an NPC. 
You can ask me questions or exit this conversation by typing "goodbye". 
Questions you may ask are who, what, when, where, and why.
Try it out!
***
who
Who am i? Why I am Khav'nik, a character in the Ad Astra Per Infernum game environment. 
This, here, is my farm you are on. 
***
what
What is this place? This place is a text based adventure game, where you can explore another world, 
learn about the lore, and evade the dreaded drunji, the enemy of our game.
***
when
When is it? That is a good question... hmm I couldn't possibly tell you.
I am a farmer, not a scientist. 
err... look at the suns in our sky, i guess.
***
where
Where are you? You are centrally located in the Ad Astra world. 
Well... close to it. This is what we call sector 8. 
If you are stuck on my farm, I leave a key located south of here at my barn.
Go ahead and GRAB it, try it on the gate where you started.
You started this game in sector 13! That can't be good luck...
***
why
Why am I here? Hey... I didn't take you for the philisophical type...
I am here to help you learn how to interact with other characters in this world.
***
goodbye
Goodbye stranger! I wish you well! Welcome to our world.
